### 7.2.2 Design Theme, Color Palette, and Typography System

**University Brand Identity:** TraviLink's design theme is centered around **Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation's official brand colors** to maintain consistency with the institution's visual identity. The **Primary Color is University Maroon (#7A0010)**, representing tradition, excellence, and institutional identity. It is used for primary navigation elements, active states, primary action buttons, request number badges, and hover states. The maroon color conveys professionalism, trustworthiness, and institutional authority.

**Secondary Colors:** Slate Gray Palette is used for neutral content, backgrounds, and text (slate-50 for light backgrounds, slate-200 for borders, slate-600 for body text, slate-900 for headings). Amber/Gold is used for service preferences, suggestions, and informational elements. Status colors include Green (Success), Yellow/Amber (Warning), Red (Error), and Blue (Informational).

**Design Philosophy:** The design follows a "Professional Minimalism" philosophy emphasizing consistency (one primary maroon color), clarity (clean layouts with ample white space), hierarchy (clear visual hierarchy using typography, color, and spacing), accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance), and brand alignment (university colors create institutional trust).

**Typography System:** TraviLink uses **Inter (Variable Font)** as the primary font, specifically designed for user interfaces and digital screens. The font stack includes system fonts for optimal performance: `'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif`. The typography scale follows a modular system: H1 (24px, 700 weight) for page titles, H2 (18px, 600 weight) for section titles, H3 (16px, 600 weight) for subsection titles, default body (14px, 500 weight) for primary content, secondary text (12px, 400 weight) for metadata, and small text (12px, 600 weight, uppercase) for labels and status indicators.

**Rationale for Design Choices:** (1) Institutional Identity - using university's official maroon reinforces official system status; (2) User Familiarity - faculty and staff are familiar with maroon from other university materials; (3) Professional Appearance - maroon with professional grays creates sophisticated, trustworthy interface; (4) Inter Font - optimized for screens with excellent readability and accessibility; (5) Variable Font Benefits - single file with multiple weights reduces bandwidth and improves performance.
