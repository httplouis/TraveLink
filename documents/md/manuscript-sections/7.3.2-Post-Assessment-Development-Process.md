### 7.3.2 Post-Assessment Development Process

#### 7.3.2.1 User Needs Assessment

Prior to development, a comprehensive assessment of user needs was conducted through:

- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Direct conversations with department heads, faculty members, administrative staff, and drivers to understand their pain points with the existing manual process
- **Process Analysis**: Examination of the current paper-based travel order and seminar application workflow
- **Requirement Gathering**: Documentation of functional and non-functional requirements based on user feedback
- **Use Case Identification**: Analysis of different user roles (faculty, head, admin, comptroller, HR, VP, president) and their specific needs

#### 7.3.2.2 Development Approach Based on Assessment

Following the user needs assessment, the development team structured the implementation in the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Authentication
Based on the assessment, the first priority was establishing a secure foundation:
- **User Authentication System**: Implemented secure login using Supabase Auth with university email validation
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Developed a comprehensive permission system to support multiple user roles (faculty, head, admin, comptroller, HR, VP, president, driver)
- **Database Schema Design**: Created normalized database structure to support complex workflow requirements

#### Phase 2: Request Creation and Management
Addressing the core functionality identified in user interviews:
- **Travel Order Form**: Developed comprehensive form with validation, draft saving, and auto-population features
- **Seminar Application Form**: Created specialized form for seminar applications with expense breakdown and applicant management
- **Multi-Requester Support**: Implemented invitation system allowing multiple requesters per travel order
- **File Attachment System**: Integrated file upload and management for supporting documents

#### Phase 3: Workflow Automation
Responding to the need for automated routing and approval:
- **Smart Workflow Engine**: Developed intelligent routing system that automatically determines approval path based on request characteristics (budget, requester role, department structure)
- **Multi-Department Endorsement**: Implemented system for handling requests involving multiple departments with automatic head endorsement invitations
- **Status Tracking**: Created real-time status tracking with visual progress indicators
- **Notification System**: Integrated email notifications for invitations, approvals, and status changes

#### Phase 4: Administrative Features
Addressing administrative staff requirements:
- **Driver and Vehicle Management**: Developed system for managing fleet resources with coding day restrictions
- **Assignment System**: Created interface for admins to assign drivers and vehicles to approved requests
- **Request Processing**: Implemented admin dashboard for reviewing and processing requests
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Added features for generating reports and tracking request statistics

#### Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements
Based on usability feedback:
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured system works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Implemented polling and WebSocket-like updates for live status changes
- **PDF Generation**: Created professional PDF export for travel orders and seminar applications
- **Search and Filter**: Added comprehensive search and filtering capabilities across all views

#### Phase 6: Integration and Testing
Final phase focusing on system reliability:
- **API Integration**: Ensured all components communicate effectively through RESTful APIs
- **Database Optimization**: Optimized queries and implemented proper indexing
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies and input validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Conducted black box testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing
