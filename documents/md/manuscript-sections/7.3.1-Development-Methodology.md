### 7.3.1 Development Methodology

#### 7.3.1.1 Agile Kanban Approach

The development of TraviLink followed the **Agile Kanban methodology**, a flexible project management framework that emphasizes continuous delivery, visual workflow management, and adaptive planning. This approach was chosen to accommodate the iterative nature of software development and to ensure that the system could evolve based on continuous user feedback and changing requirements.

#### Kanban Board Structure

The project utilized **Jira** as the primary project management tool, implementing a Kanban board divided into four primary columns to visualize and manage the development workflow:

1. **To Do**: This column contained all tasks that were identified and planned but not yet started. Tasks in this column included new features, bug fixes, enhancements, and technical improvements that were prioritized based on user needs assessment and project requirements.

2. **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on by team members were placed in this column. This provided real-time visibility into current development activities, allowing team members to coordinate efforts and avoid duplicate work.

3. **In Review**: Completed tasks awaiting code review, quality assurance testing, or stakeholder approval were moved to this column. This stage ensured that all deliverables met quality standards before being marked as complete.

4. **Done**: Successfully completed, reviewed, and approved tasks were moved to this column, representing finished work that had been integrated into the system.

#### Task Card Information

Each task card on the Kanban board contained essential information to facilitate effective project management:

- **Task Title and Description**: Clear identification of the work item and its objectives
- **Deadlines**: Target completion dates to ensure timely delivery
- **Assigned Members**: Team member(s) responsible for task execution
- **Project Labels**: Categorization tags for easy filtering and organization (e.g., "Frontend", "Backend", "Database", "API", "UI/UX")
- **Priority Levels**: Indication of task importance and urgency
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between tasks to manage workflow sequencing
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear definition of what constitutes task completion

#### Benefits of Kanban Implementation

The Kanban methodology provided several advantages during the development process:

1. **Visual Workflow Management**: The board provided an at-a-glance view of project status, making it easy to identify bottlenecks and workflow issues.

2. **Improved Team Coordination**: Team members could see what others were working on, facilitating better collaboration and knowledge sharing.

3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The Kanban approach allowed the team to quickly reprioritize tasks based on emerging requirements or user feedback without disrupting the overall workflow.

4. **Continuous Delivery**: By focusing on completing tasks in small increments, the team could deliver working features more frequently, enabling early testing and feedback collection.

5. **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**: The team maintained limits on the number of tasks in each column to prevent overloading and ensure focus on completing current work before starting new tasks.

6. **Transparency**: All stakeholders could access the board to track progress, understand current priorities, and see what was being delivered.
