### 7.3.5 Rationale for Technology Choices - Summary

The technology stack was selected based on the following key considerations:

1. **Rapid Development**: Technologies that enable fast development without sacrificing quality (Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript)
2. **Scalability**: Solutions that can grow with the system (PostgreSQL, Vercel, Supabase)
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the stack to reduce bugs (TypeScript, Zod)
4. **Developer Experience**: Tools that improve productivity and code quality (Next.js, Tailwind, Zustand)
5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Solutions with generous free tiers suitable for academic projects (Supabase, Vercel, Resend)
6. **Modern Best Practices**: Current industry standards and best practices (React 18, Next.js 14, Server Components)
7. **Security**: Built-in security features (Supabase Auth, RLS, TypeScript)
8. **Maintainability**: Technologies with good documentation and community support
9. **Performance**: Optimized for fast load times and smooth user experience
10. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Technologies that support responsive design out of the box (Tailwind CSS, Next.js)

This technology stack combination provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the TraviLink system while enabling rapid development and deployment.
