### 7.4.4 Intelligent Workflow Automation and Approval System

The workflow engine intelligently determines the approval path based on request characteristics such as budget amount, requester role, and department structure. The system automatically routes requests through the appropriate approval chain: Department Head → Administrator → Comptroller (if budget exists) → HR → VP/President. Each approver role has a customized interface tailored to their specific responsibilities. Administrators can assign drivers and vehicles to approved requests, with conflict detection to prevent double-booking. The system provides a visual status tracker showing the current position of a request in the approval workflow.
