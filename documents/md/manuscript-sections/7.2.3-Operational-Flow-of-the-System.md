### 7.2.3 Operational Flow of the System

The operational flow of TraviLink is based on comprehensive UML diagrams that illustrate the complete workflow from request submission to final approval. The system implements an intelligent, multi-stage approval process that automatically routes requests through the appropriate approval chain based on request characteristics, requester role, and organizational hierarchy.

#### **7.2.3.1 Request Submission and Initial Routing**

The operational flow begins when a faculty or staff member creates a travel request. The system automatically determines the initial approval stage based on the requester's role. For faculty/staff requests, the system sets status to `pending_head` (awaiting department head approval), while head/director/dean requests skip head approval and go directly to `pending_admin` (Administrator). The system supports multi-requester invitations and multi-department head endorsements, automatically detecting unique departments and sending endorsement invitations to appropriate department heads.

#### **7.2.3.2 Approval Workflow Stages and Routing Logic**

The system implements a comprehensive approval workflow with six main stages: (1) Department Head Approval - routes to parent head if department has parent, otherwise to Administrator; (2) Administrator Processing - assigns vehicle/driver and routes to Comptroller (if budget exists) or HR (if no budget); (3) Comptroller Budget Review - reviews budget, can send to requester for payment confirmation, then routes to HR; (4) HR Approval - routes based on requester type (Faculty+Head → VP only, Head/Director/Dean → President); (5) Executive Approval - VP for standard requests, President for head requests or high-value requests (>₱50,000); (6) Final Approval - triggers feedback notification and enables PDF generation. The system uses intelligent routing rules including parent department hierarchy detection, budget-based routing, executive level determination, and choice-based sending for approvers.

#### **7.2.3.3 Workflow Scenarios and UML Diagrams**

The system implements different workflow scenarios based on UML activity diagrams: (1) Faculty Request with Budget: Faculty → Department Head → Parent Head (if exists) → Admin → Comptroller → HR → VP → Approved; (2) Faculty Request without Budget: Faculty → Department Head → Admin → HR → VP → Approved; (3) Head/Director/Dean Request: Head → Admin → Comptroller (if budget) → HR → President → Approved; (4) Faculty + Head Included: Faculty → Department Head → Admin → HR → VP → Approved (VP is final, no President needed). The operational flow is documented through UML diagrams including Activity Diagrams (overall process flow), Sequence Diagrams (interactions between components), State Machine Diagrams (status transitions), Use Case Diagrams (all use cases and actors), and Class Diagrams (system architecture). All status transitions are logged in the request_history table with timestamps, approver information, and digital signatures.
