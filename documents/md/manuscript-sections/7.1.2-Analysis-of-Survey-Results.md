### 7.1.2 Analysis of Survey Results

Through the face-to-face interviews, the researchers identified several critical problems in the current manual travel management process at MSEUF. These problems significantly impact efficiency, transparency, and user satisfaction. The identified problems are categorized as follows:

#### **Problem 1: Manual Paper-Based Process**
**Description:** The existing system relies heavily on physical documents and manual paperwork. Faculty and staff members must fill out travel order forms manually, print multiple copies, and physically submit them to various offices for approval.

**Impact:**
- Time-consuming submission process
- Risk of document loss or misplacement
- Difficulty in tracking request status
- Inefficient document routing between departments
- High paper consumption and storage requirements

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Faculty members reported spending 2-3 hours just to complete and submit a single travel request
- Administrative staff mentioned frequent cases of lost or misplaced documents
- Department heads expressed frustration over delayed approvals due to document routing issues

---

#### **Problem 2: Lack of Real-Time Status Tracking**
**Description:** Requesters have no visibility into the current status of their travel requests. They must physically visit offices or make phone calls to inquire about approval status, causing uncertainty and delays.

**Impact:**
- Requesters cannot plan their travel effectively
- Frequent follow-ups required, wasting time for both requesters and approvers
- Lack of transparency in the approval process
- Difficulty in identifying bottlenecks in the workflow

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- 85% of faculty members reported making 3-5 follow-up calls per request
- Department heads mentioned spending significant time responding to status inquiries
- Requesters expressed frustration over not knowing when to expect approval

---

#### **Problem 3: Inefficient Approval Workflow**
**Description:** The approval process involves multiple sequential steps (Department Head → Admin → Comptroller → HR → VP → President), with requests physically moving between offices. This creates delays, especially when approvers are unavailable.

**Impact:**
- Average approval time of 5-7 business days
- Requests get stuck when approvers are on leave or unavailable
- No automatic routing or escalation mechanism
- Difficulty in identifying which stage a request is currently at

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Average approval time reported: 5-7 business days (sometimes up to 2 weeks)
- Requests often delayed when department heads or executives are unavailable
- No system to automatically route requests to alternate approvers

---

#### **Problem 4: Vehicle and Driver Scheduling Conflicts**
**Description:** The transportation office manually manages vehicle and driver assignments using paper calendars or basic spreadsheets, leading to double-booking, scheduling conflicts, and inefficient resource utilization.

**Impact:**
- Double-booking of vehicles and drivers
- Last-minute cancellations due to conflicts
- Inefficient vehicle utilization
- Difficulty in managing driver availability
- No visibility into vehicle capacity and availability

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Transportation office reported 3-5 scheduling conflicts per month
- Admin staff mentioned difficulty in tracking which vehicles are available on specific dates
- Requesters sometimes receive last-minute notifications about vehicle unavailability

---

#### **Problem 5: Budget Tracking and Payment Confirmation Issues**
**Description:** Budget approval and payment confirmation processes are disconnected. The comptroller office manually tracks budgets, and payment confirmations require additional paperwork and follow-ups.

**Impact:**
- Difficulty in tracking department budgets
- Delayed payment confirmations
- Risk of budget overruns
- Manual computation of expenses prone to errors
- No real-time budget visibility

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Comptroller office reported spending 2-3 hours per request for budget computation
- Payment confirmations often delayed due to manual processes
- Department heads expressed concern over lack of budget visibility

---

#### **Problem 6: Lack of Feedback Mechanism**
**Description:** There is no systematic way to collect feedback from faculty and staff about their travel experiences, vehicle conditions, driver performance, or service quality. This prevents continuous improvement.

**Impact:**
- No data to improve service quality
- Issues with vehicles or drivers go unreported
- No accountability for service quality
- Missed opportunities for improvement

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- 90% of faculty members reported never being asked for feedback
- Transportation office mentioned difficulty in identifying problematic vehicles or drivers
- No systematic way to track service quality metrics

---

#### **Problem 7: No Audit Trail and Documentation**
**Description:** The manual system lacks comprehensive documentation and audit trails. It is difficult to track who approved what, when, and why. Historical data is not easily accessible.

**Impact:**
- Difficulty in resolving disputes
- No accountability trail
- Challenges in generating reports
- Loss of historical data
- Compliance and transparency issues

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Administrative staff reported difficulty in retrieving past request records
- Executives mentioned lack of data for decision-making
- No way to generate comprehensive reports on travel patterns

---

#### **Problem 8: Communication Gaps**
**Description:** Communication between requesters, approvers, and the transportation office relies on phone calls, emails, and physical visits. This leads to miscommunication, missed notifications, and delays.

**Impact:**
- Important notifications may be missed
- Miscommunication about request details
- Delayed responses to inquiries
- No centralized communication channel

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Faculty members reported missing important updates about their requests
- Approvers mentioned difficulty in communicating with requesters
- No unified notification system

---

#### **Problem 9: Limited Accessibility and Mobility**
**Description:** The manual system requires physical presence at the office to submit requests, check status, or follow up. This is inconvenient, especially for faculty members who may be off-campus or have busy schedules.

**Impact:**
- Inconvenience for off-campus faculty
- Time wasted on physical visits
- Limited access during non-office hours
- Difficulty in managing requests while traveling

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Faculty members expressed need for remote access
- Off-campus faculty reported significant inconvenience
- Requests delayed when faculty members are unavailable on campus

---

#### **Problem 10: Inefficient Resource Management**
**Description:** There is no centralized system to manage vehicles, drivers, and schedules. The transportation office struggles with manual tracking of vehicle maintenance, driver availability, and optimal resource allocation.

**Impact:**
- Poor vehicle utilization
- Difficulty in maintenance scheduling
- Inefficient driver assignment
- No data-driven resource planning

**Evidence from Interviews:**
- Transportation office reported difficulty in tracking vehicle maintenance schedules
- No system to optimize vehicle and driver assignments
- Manual tracking of driver availability and workload
