### 7.4.3 Multi-User Collaboration System

The system supports multi-requester invitations and multi-department head endorsements. The main requester can invite additional faculty members to join a travel order through a searchable user selection interface. Invited users receive email notifications with secure confirmation links and can provide digital signatures. When a request includes requesters from multiple departments, the system automatically detects the unique departments involved and sends endorsement invitations to the appropriate department heads. All confirmations and endorsements are tracked in real-time.
