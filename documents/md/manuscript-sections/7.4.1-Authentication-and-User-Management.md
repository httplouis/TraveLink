### 7.4.1 Authentication and User Management

The system provides secure access control using Supabase Auth with university email validation. Users must authenticate using their official university email accounts (@mseuf.edu.ph), ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the system. The system implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system supporting multiple user roles: Faculty, Department Head, Administrator, Comptroller, HR Personnel, Vice President, President, and Driver. Each role has specific permissions and access levels, ensuring that users can only perform actions appropriate to their position in the organization hierarchy.
